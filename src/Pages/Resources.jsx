    Every Web Developer must have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Responsive Web Design is used in all types of modern web development.

ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 5) is supported in all modern browsers. Take a good look at it, especially the new array functions.

    Dig Deeper When you feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, it is time to dig deeper.

You should learn how to use Maps, Fonts and Icons in HTML.

On the JavaScript side, you should learn how to access the HTML DOM.

You should also learn how to use AJAX and JSON for making server requests.


    </p></li></a>
    <a href='' target='_blank' > <li><span>3.</span><p>
    Choose Frameworks
    Now it is time to look at some Frameworks.

On the CSS side you should choose a framework for reponsive web design:
Bootstrap  /  Material Design  /  W3.CSS

On the JavaScript side you should learn at least one modern framework:
React.js  /  Angular.js  /  Vue.js   /  W3.JS

Maybe the popularity of jQuery has passed the top, but it is still the most used JavaScript framework.

  <ol className="resourceol">
  <a href='' target='_blank' > <li><span>1.</span><p>Practice writing code
Writing programs and solving problem posted on GitHub and other developer forums can help you perfect your coding skills. Get into a habit of posting your projects on Github, GitLab and Bitbucket. It's helpful to know which programming field you want to start with.
</p></li></a>
  <a href='' target='_blank' > <li><span>2.</span><p>Learn by doing
It is possible to teach yourself how to code without following any formal method of learning. Good programming books constitute a helpful guide to coding and the profession. There are comprehensive books that include an in-depth introduction to programming. Code reference books are useful for looking up syntax and conventions of programming languages.</p></li></a>
  <a href='' target='_blank' > <li><span>3.</span><p>Certifications
Certifications supplement learning in many ways. Most employers are likely to hire certified coders over those with just formal education in programming. E-learning platforms such as Udemy, Udacity, Coursera are full of online certification programs. Even Microsoft's MCDS certification is designed for programmers and developers working on Microsoft development environment.
